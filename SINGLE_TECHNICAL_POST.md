🔐 **ExePay: Enterprise-Grade Privacy Infrastructure for Solana**

We've built the most comprehensive privacy payment platform combining zero-knowledge proofs, cryptographic protocols, and Solana's high-performance infrastructure.

**Privacy Stack:** ZK-Compressed Accounts (Light Protocol) • Shielded Balances (Groth16 zk-SNARKs) • Stealth Addresses (X25519 ECDH) • Payment Proofs • Integrated Addresses • Subaddresses • View-Tag Scanning (100x faster) • RPC Privacy Routing

**Payment Infrastructure:** Multi-token support (SOL, USDC, USDT, SPL) • Batch transfers • Recurring payments • Payment links • QR codes • Real-time analytics

**Technical Foundation:** Audited cryptography (@noble/curves, Light Protocol) • Full TypeScript SDK • React hooks • 6-wallet integration (Phantom, Solflare, Coinbase, Trust, Torus, Ledger) • Production mainnet deployment

**Privacy Score:** 7/10 current (recipient + amount hiding) → 9.5/10 roadmap (sender mixing + advanced ZK circuits)

**Innovation:** First platform to combine Monero-style stealth addresses with Solana's speed and ZK compression. Transactions under $0.001 with sub-second finality. Privacy + compliance via cryptographic payment proofs.

**Open Source:** MIT licensed • Full documentation • Production-ready
