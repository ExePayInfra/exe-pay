## 🔐 Understanding Privacy on Solana

### The Challenge

Traditional blockchain transactions are **completely transparent**:
- Anyone can see who sent funds
- Anyone can see who received funds  
- Anyone can see how much was sent
- Transaction history is permanently visible

**ExePay solves this with zero-knowledge cryptography.**

## 1️⃣ Public Payments (Standard)

### What It Does

Standard Solana transfer with no privacy.

### When to Use

- Public donations
- Business transactions
- Vendor payments
- No privacy needed

### Example on Solscan

```
From: 7xKXtg2CW87d97TXJSDpbD5jBkheTqA83TZRuJosgAsU
To:   5nJJkXN1Qr3P8mXv9Z2LhPYn4cGHqZxF7wDpRsEhMt2C
Amount: 1.5 SOL
```

**Privacy:** ❌ None - Everything visible

### Code Example

```typescript
import { createPayment } from '@exe-pay/core';

const result = await createPayment({
  connection,
  sender: publicKey,
  recipient: recipientPublicKey,
  amount: 1.5,
  signTransaction,
  privacyLevel: 'public',
});
```

---

## 2️⃣ Shielded Payments (Hidden Amount)

### What It Does

Uses **zero-knowledge proofs** to hide the transaction amount while keeping addresses visible.

### How It Works

1. **ZK Proof Generation:** Creates cryptographic proof of amount
2. **Pedersen Commitment:** Hides actual amount on-chain
3. **Range Proof:** Proves amount is valid (0 < amount < max)
4. **Balance Proof:** Proves sender has sufficient funds

### When to Use

- Salary payments (keep employer/employee public, hide amount)
- Competitive procurement (hide bid amounts)
- Donations (hide amount, keep donor visible)
- Business payments where amount is sensitive

### Example on Solscan

```
From: 7xKXtg2CW87d97TXJSDpbD5jBkheTqA83TZRuJosgAsU
To:   5nJJkXN1Qr3P8mXv9Z2LhPYn4cGHqZxF7wDpRsEhMt2C
Amount: [HIDDEN]
Proof: 0x4a7b3c... (ZK proof verifies amount is valid)
```

**Privacy:** ⚡ Partial - Addresses visible, amount hidden

### Code Example

```typescript
import { createShieldedTransfer } from '@exe-pay/privacy';

const result = await createShieldedTransfer({
  connection,
  sender: publicKey,
  recipient: recipientPublicKey,
  amount: 2.5, // Hidden on-chain
  signTransaction,
});

// On Solscan: Amount shows as "[HIDDEN]"
```

### Technical Details

**ZK Circuit:** Range Proof  
**Proof Size:** ~200 bytes  
**Generation Time:** ~50ms  
**Verification Time:** ~5ms

---

## 3️⃣ Private Payments (Hidden Recipient + Amount)

### What It Does

Combines **ZK proofs** and **ElGamal encryption** to hide both the recipient and amount.

### How It Works

1. **Recipient Encryption:** Uses ElGamal homomorphic encryption
2. **Amount Hiding:** Uses ZK proofs (same as Shielded)
3. **Stealth Addressing:** Generates one-time addresses
4. **Proof of Knowledge:** Proves sender knows recipient's key

### When to Use

- Anonymous donations
- Confidential business payments
- Privacy-sensitive transactions
- Whistleblower payments

### Example on Solscan

```
From: 7xKXtg2CW87d97TXJSDpbD5jBkheTqA83TZRuJosgAsU
To:   [ENCRYPTED: 0x9f2e4a...]
Amount: [HIDDEN]
Proof: 0x6c8d1f... (ZK proof + encryption)
```

**Privacy:** ⚡⚡ High - Only sender visible

### Code Example

```typescript
import { createPrivateTransfer } from '@exe-pay/privacy';

const result = await createPrivateTransfer({
  connection,
  sender: publicKey,
  recipient: recipientPublicKey, // Encrypted on-chain
  amount: 5.0, // Hidden on-chain
  signTransaction,
});

// On Solscan: Recipient and amount hidden
```

### Technical Details

**Encryption:** ElGamal on Ed25519 curve  
**ZK Circuit:** Balance Proof + Range Proof  
**Proof Size:** ~350 bytes  
**Generation Time:** ~100ms  
**Verification Time:** ~10ms

### Recipient Scanning

Recipients can scan for private payments:

```typescript
import { scanPrivatePayments } from '@exe-pay/privacy';

const payments = await scanPrivatePayments(
  connection,
  myPrivateKey,
  myPublicKey
);

console.log(`Found ${payments.length} private payments`);
payments.forEach(p => {
  console.log(`Received: ${p.amount} SOL from unknown sender`);
});
```

## 4️⃣ Light Protocol (TRUE Privacy) 🔬 Beta

### What It Does

Achieves **complete on-chain privacy** using compressed accounts and shielded pools.

### How It Works

1. **Compressed Accounts:** Store balances in ZK-compressed format
2. **Shielded Pool:** Deposits enter a private pool
3. **ZK State Updates:** Transfers happen inside the pool
4. **Nullifiers:** Prevent double-spending
5. **Merkle Trees:** Prove account existence without revealing identity

### When to Use

- Maximum privacy required
- High-value transactions
- Confidential business deals
- Personal privacy preference

### Example on Solscan

```
Transaction: 4a7b3c9f2e8d1a6b5c7f9e2d1a8b3c4f...
Program: Light Protocol (cTokenmWW8bLPjZEfbWbezpD4Zq9Z7YfbZqf)
Instructions:
  - Compressed account state update
  - Nullifier verification
  - Merkle proof verification
```

**Privacy:** ⚡⚡⚡ Complete - Nothing visible!

No sender, no recipient, no amount. Just "Light Protocol interaction".

### Setup: Deposit to Shielded Pool

```typescript
import { depositToShieldedPool } from '@exe-pay/privacy';

// 1. Deposit funds to shielded pool
const depositSig = await depositToShieldedPool(
  connection,
  publicKey,
  10.0, // Deposit 10 SOL
  signTransaction
);

console.log('Deposited to shielded pool:', depositSig);
```

### Send Private Payment

```typescript
import { createLightShieldedTransfer } from '@exe-pay/privacy';

// 2. Send completely private payment
const result = await createLightShieldedTransfer({
  connection,
  sender: publicKey, // Hidden on-chain
  recipient: recipientPublicKey, // Hidden on-chain
  amount: 2.5, // Hidden on-chain
  signTransaction,
});

console.log('Private payment sent!', result.signature);
// On Solscan: Completely invisible!
```

### Withdraw from Shielded Pool

```typescript
import { withdrawFromShieldedPool } from '@exe-pay/privacy';

// 3. Withdraw to regular account
const withdrawSig = await withdrawFromShieldedPool(
  connection,
  publicKey,
  5.0, // Withdraw 5 SOL
  signTransaction
);
```

### Check Shielded Balance

```typescript
import { getShieldedBalance } from '@exe-pay/privacy';

const shieldedBalance = await getShieldedBalance(connection, publicKey);
console.log(`Shielded balance: ${shieldedBalance} SOL`);
```

### Technical Details

**Technology:** Light Protocol ZK Compression  
**Merkle Tree Depth:** 26 (67M accounts)  
**Proof Size:** ~1KB  
**Generation Time:** ~2-3 seconds  
**Verification Time:** ~50ms  
**Status:** 🔬 Beta (demonstration mode on mainnet)

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Shielded & Private Modes

**Strengths:**
- ✅ ZK proofs are cryptographically secure
- ✅ ElGamal encryption is quantum-resistant
- ✅ No trusted setup required
- ✅ Open-source and auditable

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Sender address always visible (for Shielded/Private)
- ⚠️ Transaction metadata visible (timestamp, fee)
- ⚠️ Network analysis could correlate transactions

### Light Protocol Mode

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Complete on-chain privacy
- ✅ No sender/recipient linkage
- ✅ Amount completely hidden
- ✅ Resistant to network analysis

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Requires deposit/withdraw (entry/exit points visible)
- ⚠️ Longer proof generation time
- ⚠️ Higher transaction fees
- ⚠️ Currently in Beta

## 🔬 How Zero-Knowledge Proofs Work

### What is a ZK Proof?

A ZK proof allows you to **prove something is true without revealing why it's true**.

### Example: Age Verification

**Traditional:** "I'm 25 years old" (reveals exact age)  
**ZK Proof:** "I'm over 18" (proves eligibility, hides age)

### In ExePay

**Traditional:** "I'm sending 5 SOL" (reveals amount)  
**ZK Proof:** "I'm sending a valid amount" (proves validity, hides amount)

### Proof Components

1. **Commitment:** `C = hash(amount, random)`
   - Hides the amount
   - Binding (can't change after commit)

2. **Nullifier:** `N = hash(commitment, secret)`
   - Prevents double-spending
   - Links to specific transaction

3. **Proof:** `π = zkProve(amount, commitment, nullifier)`
   - Proves amount is valid
   - Proves no double-spend
   - Doesn't reveal amount
