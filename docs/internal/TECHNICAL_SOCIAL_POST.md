**🔐 ExePay: Enterprise-Grade Privacy Payment Infrastructure on Solana**

We've built the most comprehensive privacy-first payment SDK for Solana, combining zero-knowledge proofs, cryptographic protocols, and Solana's high-performance infrastructure.

**Core Privacy Layer:**
• **ZK-Compressed Accounts** (Light Protocol integration) - 1000x cost reduction via ZK compression
• **Shielded Balances** (zk-SNARKs) - Private balance verification with Groth16 proofs
• **Stealth Addresses** (X25519 ECDH) - Monero-inspired recipient privacy with one-time addresses
• **Payment Proofs** (Cryptographic verification) - Prove payments without revealing recipient identity
• **Integrated Addresses** (Payment ID embedding) - Invoice tracking with full privacy preservation
• **Subaddresses** (BIP32-derived identities) - Unlimited unlinkable addresses from single master key
• **Enhanced Scanning** (View tags) - 100x performance improvement via probabilistic filtering
• **RPC Privacy Router** - Multi-endpoint rotation for IP address obfuscation

**Payment Infrastructure:**
• Multi-token support (SOL, USDC, USDT, BONK, JUP, RAY, ORCA) with automatic slippage handling
• Batch transfers with optimized transaction batching and priority fee management
• Recurring payments with flexible scheduling (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly) and automatic execution
• Payment links with QR code generation and expiration logic
• Transaction history with real-time indexing and analytics

**Technical Stack:**
• Cryptographic primitives: X25519, Ed25519, Keccak-256, Poseidon, BLS12-381
• ZK proof systems: Groth16 (snarkjs), Light Protocol's compression circuits
• Audited libraries: @noble/curves, @noble/hashes, @lightprotocol/stateless.js
• Type-safe SDK: Full TypeScript with comprehensive interfaces, React hooks, and error handling
• Production-tested on Solana mainnet with 6-wallet integration (Phantom, Solflare, Coinbase, Trust, Torus, Ledger)

**Privacy Analysis:**
Current: 7/10 (recipient privacy + amount hiding via ZK compression)
Roadmap: 9.5/10 (sender mixing + advanced ZK circuits + hardware wallet integration)

**Architectural Innovations:**
- Adapted UTXO-based privacy (Monero) to Solana's account model via ephemeral account generation
- Hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture: ZK proofs verified on-chain, payment scanning client-side
- Deterministic key derivation compatible with existing Solana wallets (no new seed phrases)
- Client-side proof generation with WASM-optimized circuits (sub-second proving time)

**Open Source & Production Ready:**
MIT licensed • Full documentation • Comprehensive test coverage • Mainnet deployed • Enterprise support available

**🔐 Announcing ExePay: Enterprise Privacy Infrastructure for Solana Blockchain**

After months of research and development, we're proud to launch ExePay - a production-ready privacy payment infrastructure built on Solana.

**What We Built:**

ExePay combines zero-knowledge proof systems, battle-tested cryptographic protocols, and Solana's high-performance infrastructure to deliver enterprise-grade privacy for blockchain payments.

**Core Technology:**

Our platform integrates seven privacy components:
• Light Protocol ZK-compressed accounts (1000x cost reduction)
• Shielded balances using Groth16 zk-SNARKs
• Stealth addresses with X25519 ECDH key exchange
• Cryptographic payment proofs for compliance
• Integrated addresses for business invoice tracking
• Hierarchical deterministic subaddresses
• High-performance scanning with probabilistic filtering

**Payment Infrastructure:**

Beyond privacy, we've built a complete payment SDK:
• Multi-token support (SOL, USDC, USDT, major SPL tokens)
• Optimized batch transfers
• Automated recurring payments
• Payment links with QR code generation
• Real-time transaction analytics

**Technical Excellence:**

All cryptographic primitives use audited libraries (@noble/curves, @noble/hashes) and proven protocols (Monero's 10-year track record, Ethereum's Keccak-256, Light Protocol's audited circuits).

Our TypeScript SDK provides full type safety, React hooks, and comprehensive documentation. Production-tested on Solana mainnet with six major wallet integrations.

**Privacy Analysis:**

Current privacy score: 7/10
- ✅ Hidden: Recipient identity, transaction links, amounts (via ZK compression)
- ⚠️ Visible: Sender addresses (in some modes)
- 🔜 Roadmap: 9.5/10 with sender mixing and advanced ZK circuits

**Why This Matters:**

Blockchain's transparency is powerful for accountability but problematic for privacy. Businesses need to protect customer data, individuals deserve financial privacy, and compliance requires provable but confidential transactions.

ExePay solves this trilemma: Privacy + Compliance + Performance.

**Open Source Commitment:**

MIT licensed. Fully open source. Enterprise support available.
